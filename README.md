### Movie-App-client

Installed React and created the first build using Parcel (parcel src/index.html)
Added components to create views:  
* main-view.jsx (MainView) : Main view set-up that imports other view components and contains the movies array (model) and logic for switching between views
* movie-card.jsx (MovieCard) : individual movies rendered in the MainView 
* movie-view.jsx (MovieView) : further details that are displayed when a MovieCard is clicked in the MainView
* login-view.jsx (LoginView) : A form that is rendered for users to log in or choose to register
* register-view.jsx (Registerview) : A form that is rendered for new users to register with the myFlix Movie App
